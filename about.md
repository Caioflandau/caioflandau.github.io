Head of Mobile Development at Mozio, an awesome ground transportation startup you should [check before your next trip](http://www.mozio.com/). Developer with a passion for process improvement. Lately, I've been working mainly with mobile development. But have spent quite some time working with web front-end, mainly in Angular and React.

Having worked on many exciting projects in the past, from augmented reality to innovative mobile payment platforms, I love what I do. Sounds clich√©, I know. But I'm probably one of the few who actually mean it!

Oh, and also a travel addict! I'm planning my next trip. Constantly. I feel happier when there's a plane ride coming up.
