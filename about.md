Software Engineer at Mozio, an awesome ground transportation startup you should [check before your next trip](http://www.mozio.com/). Developer with a passion for process improvement. Although I've been working mainly with web front-end lately, I'm also an experienced mobile (Android & iOS) developer.

Having worked on many exciting projects in the past, from augmented reality to innovative mobile payment platforms, I love what I do. Sounds clich√©, I know. But I'm probably one of the few who actually mean it!

Oh, and also a travel addict! I'm planning my next trip. Constantly. I feel happier when there's a plane ride coming up.
