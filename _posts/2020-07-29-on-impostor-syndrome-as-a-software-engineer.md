Impostor syndrome. Most engineers have heard that term before. In this post I'll talk about my view on this, with thoughts that helped me mitigate the feeling. Turn impostor syndrome around and use it to your advantage!

# Have you ever felt like this?
How many programming languages are out there being used in the wild? How many different libraries? There are dozens of different ways to achieve the same goals when writing software. How come I have no experience in this hugely popular framework? Seems like most people around me know more than I do!

# More is not always better
Our industry seems to want to quantify everything: we hire based on number of years of experience, _number_ of apps you've published, _number_ of web frameworks you know, _number_ of backend platforms. The way I see it, this is a major contributor to impostor syndrome. You look at a job posting and think "I don't have experience with all those tools. Seems like everyone else does!". Hint: they don't.

You don't _need_ to know a dozen front-end frameworks to do well as a front-end engineer. What you do need is a good grasp on the base concepts of web development. Frameworks, libraries and programming languages are just tools. You can learn the tools if you know the base.

# Leverage impostor syndrome
So what if everyone on your team knows SwiftUI better than you? Learn from them! Maybe you know Flutter and no one on your team does? It's almost impossible that everyone knows everything you know and more. Do you see where the disconnect is?

It's easy to feel overwhelmed when it seems like you are constantly sumbling upon things you don't know, while _everyone else_ does. Here's a heads up: this feeling will not go away. As long as you are moving forward, you will find people who have had experiences you haven't. And that's a good thing: you are now experiencing those things! You are not obligated to know everything from the start. Use impostor syndrome to fuel your desire to learn and keep growing.

# You know more than you think. Others know less than it seems
Here's how I started to accept impostor syndrome: I realized everyone has their own work experience. There is just too much when it comes to software engineering - no one person will know everything. You need to realize you know many things other people don't - and they know many things you don't. It's ok to not know everything. In fact, isn't it annoying to work with someone who thinks they are the best at everything? 

Keep growing, don't be too hard on yourself, and understand that learning is a major part of work as a Software Engineer. Keep in mind: it's not that everyone knows _more_ than you. They just have _different_ knowledge.
